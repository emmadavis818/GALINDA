GALINDA is a Galaxy Image N-Body Data Animator Python package. GALINDA is a mathplotlib.pyplot wrapper designed to provide 2D Histogram images of particles or data from a simulation and an animation of these histograms. The suite of functions in this package are useful for obtaining a quick overall view of your simulated astronomical object and its evolution over snapshots or time-steps. With the ability to display one frame, a collage of frames, or an animation, this package is not only limited to astronomical or simulation data, and can be used for any general 2D data visualization and data evolution.

Inputs: A folder containing HDF5 files of particle position data for a given snapshot or time-step. 

Package Requirements: numpy, matplotlib, h5py, ffmpeg
